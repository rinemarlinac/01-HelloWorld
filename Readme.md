# Rine's Revit API & BIM Automation Portfolio

Hi, I’m Rine — a BIM Drafter with a growing obsession for Revit automation, C#, and getting Revit to do more with less manual clicking.

This repo is where I document my experiments (and occasional triumphs) with the Revit API. I started with Autodesk’s Developer Guide and built upon it, trying to combine my MEP modeling knowledge with actual code.
